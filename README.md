A pop-up cat cafe in Boston, which may hopefully become somewhat permanent


Opening any sort of food-related in Boston can be excruciating. Instead, we decided to start with a pop-up cafe and a small audience. The idea is to use it as a pilot and later on include it as part of the proposal for a permanent site.

Since funding was an issue, we went searching for grants and initiatives that would support this kind of project. That is how we ran into the MindHandHeart Innovation Fund at MIT (http://mindhandheart.mit.edu/innovation-fund).

Here is our proposal:

Twitter pitch: Reduce stress and make new human (and feline) friends over a cup of coffee!

What would you like to accomplish with this work? Please describe specific goals you have for this project. *
-Create a safe space for our peers to interact, create new friendships, take a break from regular activities and release stress.
-Increase the connectivity among MITâ€™s community members and encourage mental health as well as work-life balance.
-Give the community a chance to interact with animals and support the goals of local animal shelters
-Increase awareness of the impact that high-stress has on efficiency and  on long-term physical and mental health.

Who will be served? How will your work benefit the MIT community? *
We will be reaching out to students, staff and faculty. We anticipate for people to come out feeling less stressed, rested and happier. Having a clear mind and a feeling happy allows for greater efficiency and that is something we expect to achieve through this project. 

What is the timeline for this project? Do you anticipate your work being short term or developing into an ongoing project? *
We would like for this event to be aligned with the next final exam period (Dec 14-18) but could also be launched at an alternative date. There is always a need for stress-reduction in our community and this project would provide a safe environment for it to happen. If proven successful, We are envisioning this to be an ongoing project that would develop into a regular event.

Have preparations already taken place? If so, what are they? *
I have been in touch with Nevis Farm and they are very excited about this project. They  would like to support it by giving us access to a group of their friendliest cats. In addition, quotes for different coffee/pastries providers have been requested and will also be reaching out to the CAC facilities team to explore space options for this event.

How would partial funding affect your ability to complete this proposed work? *
Receiving partial funding would affect the scale and reach of this initiative. We would need to reduce the size of the room where the event would be hosted as well as limiting the attendance as to keep the costs in line with the funding provided.

Is there additional information you would like the committee to consider? *
We are planning on making this a two-day event to be able to accommodate the different schedules and needs of our community and also have an attendance of roughly 300 people per day. It is a project we have been thinking about for a long time and would love to receive your support! Thanks!
